NASA Space App Project
This project was created as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge. It involves data analysis and machine learning techniques to solve real-world challenges in space exploration.

Project Description
The code in this project leverages various data science tools and methodologies to address a problem in the domain of space exploration. Specifically, the project aims to:

Analyze data related to find out the possibly outbrust of glacier lakes and map out vulnerable communities.
Build a machine learning model to predict/analyze/forecast vulnerable communities for glacier lake outbrust flood (GLOF).
Visualize results using various Python libraries.
