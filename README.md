NASA Space App Project

This project was created as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge. It involves data analysis and machine learning techniques to solve real-world challenges in space exploration.

Project Description

The code in this project leverages various data science tools and methodologies to address a problem in the domain of space exploration. Specifically, the project aims to:

Analyze data related to find out the possibly outbrust of glacier lakes and map out vulnerable communities.
Build a machine learning model to predict/analyze/forecast vulnerable communities for glacier lake outbrust flood (GLOF).
Visualize results using various Python libraries.

The datasets used in this project are created using google earth engine (GEE). Digitization of glacier lakes is done with DIgitization Model of GEE and can be accessed through
